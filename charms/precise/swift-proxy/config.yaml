      Which policy to use when assigning new storage nodes to zones.
      .
        manual - Allow swift-storage services to request zone membership.
        auto - Assign new swift-storage units to zones automatically.
      .
      The configured replica minimum must be met by an equal number of storage
      zones before the storage ring will be initially balance.  Deployment
      requirements differ based on the zone-assignment policy configured, see
      this charm's README for details.
