          Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
          distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
          or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

          Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
          cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
          cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

          When deploying to Precise, the default distro option will use
          the cloud:precise-folsom/updates repository instead, since Cinder
          was not available in the Ubuntu archive for Precise and is only
          available via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.

        description: |
            This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
            object it stores withing the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
            applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
            rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
            effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
            your ceph cluster).

          Newer storage drivers may require the v2 Glance API to perform certain
          actions e.g. the RBD driver requires requires this to support COW
          cloning of images. This option will default to v1 for backwards
          compatibility older glance services.
